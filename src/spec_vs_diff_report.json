  "summary": "Core Valentine prompt/reveal UI and romantic styling appear to be implemented in frontend/src/App.tsx and frontend/src/index.css, including an evasive “No” behavior and a “Yes” reveal with a statically referenced meme image path. However, the required static image asset itself is not present in the diff, and the reveal text shown in the UI does not clearly match the exact “Good choice❤️” requirement. The diff also introduces unrelated Internet Identity/auth and backend actor files that were not requested and may violate stated constraints/non-goals.",

      "reason": "The UI references /assets/generated/valentine-good-choice-meme.dim_1024x1024.png, but the diff does not show the required image file being added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
